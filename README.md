# Yeoman Wordpress Generator

  Generator to use Yeoman on a Wordpress project.

  For more informations about Yeoman, see [Yeoman.io](http://yeoman.io/)

## Installation (for Yeoman >= 0.9.3)

  Here is a way to install globally the generator, which means you will be able to use it everywhere (this works on a Mac, I have no idea how this works on Linux or Windows).
  You may need to follow this procedure every time you update Yeoman.

* `$ cd /usr/local/lib/node_modules/yeoman/node_modules/yeoman-generators/lib/generators`
* `$ git clone git://github.com/romainberger/yeoman-wordpress.git` (you may need to run this with `sudo`)

#### Uninstalling

  Here is how to uninstall the generator
  
  * `$ cd /usr/local/lib/node_modules/yeoman/node_modules/yeoman-generators/lib/generators`
  * `$ rm -rf yeoman-wordpress/`
  

## Documentation

### Init

  `$ yeoman init yeoman-wordpress` - Generates a new Wordpress project with a starter theme and the files needed to use Yeoman. Once Yeoman is done, install your new wordpress project, and activate the theme in the admin panel.

  Yeoman will ask you which version of Wordpress you want to use (latest stable version by default).
  The starter theme used is [_s](https://github.com/automattic/_s) but you can specify another theme if you want.

### Server

  `$ yeoman server` - Since wordpress is a php framework, the yeoman server task can't be use directly. Here is how you can use it ([thanks to @mklabs](https://github.com/yeoman/yeoman/issues/250#issuecomment-8024212)):

* Start the yeoman server: `$ yeoman server`. You can close the page it opened, you won't use it.
* Go to the wordpress with the host you created in Mamp or whatever you are using
* Activate the LiveReload extension by clicking its button in your browser.

### Build

  `$ yeoman build` - Build an optimized version of your app, ready to deploy *(Still needs some work)*
